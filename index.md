I am an evolutionary biologist specializing in the diversity and evolution of parasitic wasps. These organisms, though often tiny, contribute an estimated 20% of terrestrial animal species and play diverse and important roles in many ecosystems, including natural control of insect pests. However, the evolutionary forces that have driven the explosive diversification of parasitic wasps remain poorly-understood. My long-term aim is to establish and lead a research group that explores the causation of the enormous abundance and species richness of specialized herbivores and their associated parasitoid communities. Only with such understanding can we predict, for example, the consequences of climate change on the abundance and distribution of these systems and its effect on the ecosystem. <br>

## RESEARCH
**Hymenoptera Phylogenomics using Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs)** <br>
My current postdoc work focuses on using UCEs to generate genomic-level data to reconstruct the phylogeny of Ants, Rose Gall Wasps (Cynipidae: _Diplolepis_), Oak Gall Parasitoids (Eurytomidae: _Sycophila_), and designing probe sets for nematodes (Order Rhabditida). Ultraconserved elements have been shown to be very effective at resolving phylogenetic relationships at both deep and shallow evolutionary scale, and can be used on older museum specimens that have degraded DNA. I have also led a review paper on arthropod UCEs phylogenomics, which explains the technique and offers best-practice tips for downstream analyses.<br>

Formicidae: _Nylanderia fulva_

**Taxonomy and Systematics of Gall Wasps and Associated Natural Enemies** <br>
I am also interested in taxonomy of gall wasp and their associated natural enemies, in particular Eurytomidae. For my masters degree I revised the Canadian species of eurytomids associated with rose gall wasps (Cynipidae: _Diplolepis_). I used _COI_ to delimit species and provided an updated key along with the description of a new species. I have also used _COI_ to rebuild the phylogeny of _Diplolepis_ and their inquiline _Periclistus_, which shows the both genera are in need of revision and gall morphology alone is not enough to identify these species. A few other related collaboration projects I've worked on includes the insects associated with the crypt gall wasp _Bassettia pallida_, including describing the crypt keeper wasp _Euderus set_. Currently I am revising oak gall wasp _Belonocnema_, and describing the gall community associated with _Smilax_ in southern Florida.<br>

**The Evolution of _Peristenus_ (Hymenoptera: Braconidae): Taxonomy, Phylogenetics and Ecological Speciation** <br>
The focus of my PhD research was to investigate speciation patterns of  euphorine braconid wasps at the genus, species, and population level. _Peristenus_ are parasitoids agricultural pests such as Lygus bugs. I built a multilocus phylogeny of the tribe Euphorini and revised generic concepts (Zhang et al 2018a); revised the North American _Peristenus pallipes_ complex using a combination of molecular, morphometrics, and ecological data; and used ddRADSeq to determine that temporal separation is likely a key driver behind the _Lygus-Peristenus_ system. <br>
